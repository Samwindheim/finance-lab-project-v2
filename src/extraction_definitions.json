        "extraction_prompt": "You are an expert AI assistant specializing in Swedish financial data tables. Your task is to extract all investor data it as structured JSON.\n\nYou will be given one or more images of a document page and the raw text extracted from those pages.\nAn possibly some more additional text.\n- First use the image to understand the table structure (rows, columns, and layout).\n- Only after you have processing the table structure, use the provided text as the ground truth for spelling and numbers.\n- If there is a discrepancy between the image and the text in terms of spelling, the text is more likely to be correct.\n\n**Key Objectives (Important – Do Not Skip Anything):**\n1. Examine every row and column carefully. Do not miss any investors or data points.\n2. Each investor row → one JSON object.\n3. If the same investor has multiple roles, create separate objects for each role with there respective amount.\n4. Do not include totals, summary rows, or non-investor data.\n\n**Fields to Extract:**\n- name\n- amount_in_cash: The monetary commitment (e.g., SEK, EUR).\n- amount_in_percentage: The percentage commitment (e.g., %).\n- level: The investor level as defined below.\n\n**Investor Levels:**\n- Underwriters (“Teckningsåtagare”, “Teckningsförbindelser” or similar) → 0\n- If mulitple kinds of Tecknings (genom befintliga, utan teckningsrätter) for an investor, sum the values in to one data point \n- For underwriters, only extract amounts associated with \"teckna i Företrädesemissionen\" or similar phrases explicitly linking the commitment to the Rights Issue\n\n- Guarantor (“Garantier” or \"Brygglån\") → 1\n- If a tiered guarantee system is specified (e.g., “Botten-garantier”, “Bottom-up garantiåtaganden”), assign level 1 to bottom-tier guarantors and level 2 to top-tier guarantors (“Toppgarantier”, “Top-down garantiåtaganden”)\n- Pay close attention to text describing guarantor roles. An investor who has priority should be classified as a top-tier guarantor (level 2).\n- If percentage range table headers are provided ex: higher = level 2 or lower = level 1\n- It is important to ensure gaurantor levels are accurate\n- Default to Null if it is ambiguous\n\n**Data Cleaning Rules:**\n- amount_in_cash:\n  - Remove spaces, currency symbols, letters\n  - Ranges → keep as strings (apply unit multiplication if numeric)\n  - Commas in decimals → convert to periods (e.g., “123 456,10” → 123456.10)\n- amount_in_percentage:\n  - Remove % symbol, replace commas with periods, store as float\n- Names:\n  - Preserve original spelling, punctuation, and capitalization\n  - Remove trailing numbers (e.g., “Jim Joe1” → “Jim Joe”)\n  - Remove ending asterisks\n  - Write \"Övriga\" (Others) data as \"?\" for the name\n  - Replace newlines with spaces (e.g., “Svanberg & Co\\nInvest AB” → “Svanberg & Co Invest AB”)\n  - Remove things like \"(privat och via bolag)\"\n  - Remove titles or descriptions like \"styrelseledamot\" or \"CTO, advisor\" or \"as Trustee of\" \n  - Remove \"Fonder som...\" just grab the name\n\n**Processing Instructions:**\n1. Work row by row, extracting all fields according to rules.\n2. If a value cannot be determined from the text or image, use `null`. Do not invent data.\n3. Validate that every row from the table is represented in JSON.\n4. Output only JSON. No extra text, explanations, or formatting.\n5. Ensure numbers are correctly transformed according to the rules above.\n6. Ignore all collective commitment totals where the individual investor names are referenced as being in a separate, unprovided document\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not invent data. If a value for a specific field is not clear, you MUST use null for that field. Do not attempt to guess or infer missing values. Do not extract investors that are not tecknings or garant. Do not extract investors that you are not sure are part of the data set. Keep in mind that it is possible that the data might only be in the text and not the images.\n\n**Output Format Example:**\n{\n  \"investors\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Tuvedalen Ltd.\",\n      \"amount_in_cash\": 1652367.00,\n      \"amount_in_percentage\": 9.4,\n      \"level\": 0\n    }\n  ]\n}"
