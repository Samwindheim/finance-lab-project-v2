Important:
My test script rounds both my data and manual data down to 
the integer. My extraction actually outputs with the decimal places.
But this testing strategy accounts for the manual data sometimes 
being rounded and sometimes not.

Maybe do the same for Aktiebolag vs AB? Change that part of the string to always be AB

TESTING

Fail cases:

- Inconsistent decimal usage in manual data. Most round down, some don't.
id: c7d40245-fea1-4c49-9f40-9e454dc6e16e - doesn't round down

- Data under different headers decriptions like "Aktieägare"
id: 99102636-5e9b-456d-a87b-479d223fe922 - grabs wrong page, data is under "större aktieägare"
id: 5b602395-7655-4183-818c-71a556481a59 - maybe include "Övriga" (others) as "?"

- Manual data not present in the pdfs.
id: f5c8d679-3ccf-4a4c-a761-b9fc7fc50fac

- Image pdfs, first source in sources.json is like this. Will add OCR option to get text
id: 467ba3df-7ead-4914-9011-d84707be1f4c

- Inconsistent naming of investors 
ex: AB vs Aktieägare

Thoughts:
Inconsistent naming schemes makes it difficult to test programmatically. Some cases
where I think manual data is wrong. Cases where I can't even find the data in the pdfs - don't know where it came from.
